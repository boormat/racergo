An implementation of RacerWii but in Go

RacerWii helps track racers on long distance races like a 5k.  It's meant to be a high-tech low cost way of creating and displaying race results.  It's primary use case is for fund raiser type 
races where buying RFID chips for each runner is over the top and too costly.
