racergo
==========

An application to help the timing of long distance races including registration and displaying results and prizes. Features include:
* Calculate Prizes (e.g. Overall Male, Female Under 15, etc)
* Web interface for entering and displaying results to racers/spectators (http://raceresults/admin & http://raceresults/ respectively)
* Meant to be used with a wireless/wifi hotspot configuration as all requests get directed to hostname raceresults
* Download race results in a combined CSV (Entries (names, tshirt size, etc) & Results (time, overall place))
* Entering Bib # information for each racer as they cross the line

RacerWii helps track racers on long distance races like a 5k.  It's meant to be a high-tech low cost way of creating and displaying race results.  It's primary use case is for fund raiser type
races where buying RFID chips for each runner is over the top and too costly.
