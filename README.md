racerwiigo
==========

An implementation of RacerWii (http://github.com/mzimmerman/racerwii) but in Go

RacerWii helps track racers on long distance races like a 5k.  It's meant to be a high-tech low cost way of creating and displaying race results.  It's primary use case is for fund raiser type 
races where buying RFID chips for each runner is over the top and too costly.

racerwiigo differs from RacerWii since it has a web interface to display the race results.  Additionally, it is meant to be used as a captive portal for runners & fans to watch the race and get the results.  It also has an administrative interface which allows assigning Bib #'s as well as recording the Bib #'s that come across in order to display results and rankings by name.
